        We are here to help you, to provide free lectures from the Faculty of Informatics Engineering<br>at the
        University of Tishreen to our fellow students who are following instructors.<br>
        Because of what we live in the last period, we decide to do this, to help each other.<br>

        One of the secret keys of success is to practice, practice, and practice,<br>
        we know that if we want a thing and work for it we can reach it and win.<br>
        In our life, everything is going to challenge us, trying to make us fail,<br>
        but like we said, if we want a thing, we can reach it.
