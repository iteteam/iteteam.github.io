            <h1>Advanced Programming 1 C++</h1>
            <p>
                C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language,
                or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented,
                generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language,
                and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
                C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]
                C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).[12] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language;
                he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012,
                C++ is on a three-year release schedule, with C++23 the next planned standard.
